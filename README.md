# fantasy_football_app
This is the home of the [stats web app](tcccff.streamlit.app) for my fantasy
football league.

It uses the data created by an ELT pipeline managed by my other repositories:
- Extract and Load with https://github.com/robastel/fantasy_football_ingestion
- Transform with https://github.com/robastel/dbt
