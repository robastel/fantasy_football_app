# fantasy_football_app
This is the home of the historical statistics app for my fantasy football 
league.

It can be found at https://share.streamlit.io/robastel/fantasy_football_app/main/app.py

It uses the data created by an ELT pipeline managed by my other repositories:
- Extract and Load with https://github.com/robastel/fantasy_football_ingestion
- Transform with https://github.com/robastel/dbt
